# Overview



This particular Software program I built was meant to for me to learn the basics of java and 
how it is to work. What I built was a simple calculator application that does simple arithmetic
operations. The simplicity in it is what allowed me to really get something unique working.
Overall, this project taught me alot about the concept of java and how it is structured.
